Uplifting Rural Communities (URUCO) is a community based organization located in Nampunge village, Kakiri Sub County, Wakiso district, Uganda. URUCO received a grant of £250 from Sead fund to implement a project on educating young adolescent girls how to make reusable sanitary pads and menstrual hygiene at Mwanga Secondary School.

> "My name is Odoi Anne, I am in form two and am 14 years old. I have been using dry animal skin specifically goat skin as a sanitary pad though it has been very uncomfortable and unhygienic for me. My parents couldn’t afford buying pads for me but because of Sead fund’s love for the unprivileged people like me, I am now able to make my own re-usable sanitary pads that can last me a full year. Thank you Sead fund for working with Uplifting Rural Communities to improve people’s lives."

Thank you for giving us this opportunity to implement this project because it has greatly improved the young female adolescent girls’ lives."

### Project implementation

We visited Mwanga secondary school where the adolescent girls where taught how to make reusable sanitary pads and also were taught about menstrual hygiene in order to improve their welfare. Below are some of the impact stories from the beneficiaries about the project:

> “My name is Namusis Betty, I am in form two and am 14years old. I have been facing a lot of challenges ever since I started my menstruation, for example I have always had to miss out on school during my menstruation period because my parents can’t afford buying for me sanitary pads and also, I  feared staining my uniform while at school. This greatly affected my performance but am now very grateful to Sead Fund for working together with Uplifting Rural Communities because I got a chance to learn how to make my own sanitary pads and also learnt about menstrual hygiene which I had no idea about. The training has helped improve my confidence and also helped me stay in school during my menstruation period. I am going to make sure I study hard so that I can also grow up and help people in need just like you have helped me. Thank you very much and may God bless you.”  

> “I am Ms. Among Cathy the senior woman of Mwanga Secondary School. I want to take this opportunity to thank Sead fund for collaborating with Uplifting Rural Communities in order to improve the children’s health and equipping them with a skill of making their own reusable sanitary pads because a number of the adolescent girls have been facing different challenges during their menstrual period. Through the training, I have gotten learn more about menstrual hygiene and how best I can handle cases of girls that are new to menstruation. Also the training has helped to boost the confidence of the girls as they can now approach me or their fellow students in case they have a problem or need menstrual materials. Lastly, I can now pass on the skill attained of making reusable sanitary pads to other generations of students. I want to thank you once again for this great opportunity that you gave our school and for the good work also pray you continue working with Ms. Nanyonjo Yvonne of Uplifting Rural Communities so that you impact more people.”
   
> “Dear Sead fund, my name is Nabirye Esther, Iam in form one and I am 13 years old. I am very grateful for the love you have shown us because of your kindness, I was able to learn how to make reusable sanitary pads and about menstrual hygiene. When I started menstruation, my mother gave me some of her old clothes to cut them into small pieces which I have been using during my menstruation period even though they were very uncomfortable for me making it hard for me to concentrate in class and I had decided to drop out of school as I was tired being uncomfortable while at school. Due to the training done by Uplifting Rural Communities, I can now make my own reusable sanitary pads which will last longer and also are going to help me stay in school and accomplish my goals of becoming a doctor. Thank you Sead Fund.”
