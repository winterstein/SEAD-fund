The Community Growing Project has revitalized two local sites with the help of volunteers and our community gardener. This year’s work included cleaning, weeding, and preparing land for cultivation. In early 2025, we plan to expand the growing area with new raised beds and composting.

We ran various workshops, including a kids' gardening club where children successfully grew salad leaves, beetroots, and carrots, thanks to a favourable summer. Autumn focused on maintenance, building a wheelchair-accessible path, and a new greenhouse. Highlights included wildflower seed bomb workshops and spring bulb planting sessions, fostering awareness of biodiversity and sustainability.

Our neighbourhood network group played an active role, promoting community spirit, healthier eating, and inter-generational learning. Looking ahead, we’ll continue with “Grow Your Own” workshops and expand gardening clubs to engage more people in growing fresh, local food.

This project has brought many benefits to the community. It has sparked a growing interest in food cultivation and environmental workshops, fostering a sense of achievement, ownership, and community spirit among participants. By engaging people of all ages and abilities, the project continues to enhance community connections, support wellbeing, and contribute to local ecological conservation.
