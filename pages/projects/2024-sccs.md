SEAD is a member of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, a coalition of organisations working to raise awareness of the climate emergency and to campaign for urgent action.

SCCS has been instrumental in advocating for the "Rethinking Scotland's Road Map" initiative, which aims to make cleaner, greener travel easier for everyone. This initiative includes measures to improve public transportation, encourage cycling and walking, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Additionally, SCCS has been a vocal advocate for stronger climate policies. Their open letter to the First Minister calls for the end of emission reduction targets and urges the government to take more decisive action in combating climate change.

By supporting SCCS, SEAD is contributing to a broader movement that seeks to protect the environment and promote sustainable living in Scotland and beyond.
