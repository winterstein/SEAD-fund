We ran the project to enable women to connect with each other and nature in a safe environment, whilst also helping to improve the refuge garden space for our tenants. The sessions delivered were a mixture of the good and bad weather planning , due to Orkneyâ€™s unpredictable weather where we can experience four seasons in a few hours. The sessions were well attended with a total of 20 women coming along and 5 staff members joining in. We changed the lawn area by adding curved boarders and natural planting to soften the fencing so that the whole garden felt more welcoming. The children staying in refuge also joined in at times, expressing they were looking forward to seeing things grow and hopefully to see some bees in the spring/summer. One family who have since left refuge have been back recently to check on the bulbs and bug houses.
