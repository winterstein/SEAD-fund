Stigma towards mental health and LGBT issues can particularly hurt teenagers. It can be difficult for teachers to address. A student survey at Castle Douglas High School revealed less than 50% of the pupils would feel comfortable talking to a member of staff regarding mental health troubles or expressing their sexuality or gender identity. So with the SEAD-Fund's support, Castle Douglas High School added LGBT and mental health books to their library, to provide a discreet way for pupils to access information about sexuality.

> "Our LGBT friendly literature now available has helped pupils in our school have various options to learn to be comfortable with themselves. The literature is well used by our youngsters."
