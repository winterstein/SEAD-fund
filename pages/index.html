<h2>What We Fund</h2>

SEAD Fund grants are small grants for individuals or groups. Grants are typically £100 - £250. We fund positive action,
and campaigning. We look for proposals where the grant will have the most impact -- for example, helping a new campaign
to get started, or funding a specific concrete action for a local community. We do not normally fund travel, e.g. to
visit a conference. We promote social justice, with a current focus on the following areas:

- climate justice
- inequality
- poverty
- women's rights
- young people and their global rights
- health justice

<h2>About</h2>

Founded in 1978, SEAD stands for Scottish Education and Action for Development. SEAD has two main aims:

1. To challenge the causes of poverty, social injustice and environmental degradation.
2. To support the community-based movement for positive social change - people collectively tackling challenges which
have both a local and global perspective.

Our work is based on the following principles:

- People-powered solutions.
- Rooted in mutual solidarity.
- We can all learn from each other.
