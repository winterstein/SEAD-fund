It's worth noting that SEAD funding is open to individuals as well as organisations. Suzanne is an experienced midwife and mum of four working in Midlothian, as well as a practitioner of Kundalini yoga. She dreamed of delivering classes for expectant mothers, teaching "kundalini yoga techniques and meditations to improve health in all systems of the body and help relax and reduce stress to prepare for birth and motherhood." However, the specialised yoga teacher training she needed is expensive, required her to travel to Berlin for a week, and wasn't covered by her employer.

Suzanne didn't let this get in her way: as well as reaching out to SEAD, she put away savings and did her own fundraising, including a curry night. Suzanne shared this photo of her and classmates on their final day of training. Suzanne's yoga classes will include low cost options for low income mothers, and she's going to pay-it-forward with the SEAD-grant by providing some free classes.
