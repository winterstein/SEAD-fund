# Scottish Education and Action for Development (SEAD) Annual Report 2024

## Chair's Foreword

Dear Members and Supporters,  

Our commitment to tackling poverty, promoting education, fostering environmental sustainability, and standing against injustice is more important now than ever. Thanks to the support of our members, donors, volunteers, and trustees, SEAD has successfully implemented a diverse range of projects across Scotland and internationally.

This year we awarded **15 micro-grants**, supporting grassroots initiatives that are making a real difference in their communities. From educational programs and environmental projects to campaigns advocating for human rights, our reach and impact has been significant. By empowering individuals and organizations, we are collectively achieving more than we ever could alone.

Looking forward, we aim to strengthen our grant-making processes, grow the SEAD-Fund, and enhance member engagement. Thank you for being part of our work for positive change.  

Warm regards,    
Daniel Winterstein   
Chair of Trustees
