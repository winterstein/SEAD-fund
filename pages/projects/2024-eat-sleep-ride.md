The Community Garden Project, supported by grant funding last year, aimed to create an accessible, nature-rich space for young people and the wider community. Despite facing severe weather challenges, significant progress was made in preparing the site for planting and future engagement.

Storms caused substantial damage to parts of the site, impacting the original plans. However, resilience and adaptability ensured that the groundwork continued. Raised beds were constructed and are now ready for sowing in March, providing a solid foundation for community gardening activities. Additionally, accessible pathways were installed, a wildlife pond was created to enhance biodiversity, and a sensory garden area was developed to promote well-being.

This project remains a key part of our commitment to inclusion, sustainability, and youth engagement. As we move forward, we will continue to rebuild and cultivate this space, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for the community.
