The Den playpark in Aberdeenshire is already a much loved fixture in the lives of local families, but the newly formed community organisation Friends of the Den think it could be even better. They have started surveying Den users to gauge interest in play equipment geared to different ability levels and sensory needs, as well as encouraging parents to share their old favourites and what retired equipment they would like to see return.
