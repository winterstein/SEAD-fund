SEAD-Fund, in collaboration with Fahari Safari, is proud to announce the launch of the "Books to School" program. This initiative invites safari guests to bring along second-hand children's books to donate, helping to create and grow school libraries in Tanzania, where many children have little or no access to books. These books are invaluable, providing a way to learn English with a dose of joy, and fostering a lifelong love for reading.

> If you visit Arusha in Tanzania, then participating in the *Books to School* program is simple: Just pack a few English-language children's books in your luggage. Our team can deliver the books to local schools in need.

Think of your favourite childhood book. Now imagine the joy of sharing that book with a child who has never had the chance to read it -- a child who might never have read any children's books, only textbooks. This is the magic of the *Books to School* program.

The first Books to School mini library was opened this month at Arusha Victory School, a primary school in Tanzania.
