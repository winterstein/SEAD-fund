Rock music is still a male dominated industry. Girls Rock School Edinburgh (GRSE) aims to turn that around, by providing one hour weekly classes in vocals, guitar, drum and bass to self-identifying women (trans* and non-binary inclusive) aged eighteen and over.

One off songwriting, sound engineering and DJing workshops are sometimes available too. All their workshops are free to attend and are held in a wheelchair accessible space. Each class ends with a jam session with students from different classes rocking out together. At the end of term, GRSE musicians have the opportunity to play a showcase gig and realise their dreams of rock stardom on a local scale.

the running of our next term! Can't wait to do more of this!!!"
