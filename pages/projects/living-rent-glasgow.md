"This is not going to be a boring AGM, because we're not a boring union!" On 13th October, Living Rent Glasgow members convened to set out their collective vision for building tenant power in the year ahead. The union aims to be accessible for as many people as possible, stating in their AGM report that food and childcare are "an integral part of enabling access for more and more members, ensuring longevity as a movement. To this aim, Living Rent Glasgow invested their SEAD grant into food, promotion and materials. As Living Rent member Joey put it in his fiery closing speech:
 
> When Living Rent comes knocking, you better answer the door! We see
you locking the doors to your fancy offices! We're here for the long haul,
we've got tea and sandwiches, we're not going anywhere!
