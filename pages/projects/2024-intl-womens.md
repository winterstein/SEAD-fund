After group discussions about the situation in Palestine, IWG applied for a grant to campaign. The conflict has environmental impacts from bombings, affects women whose human rights are being abused, and leaves children with little hope for the future. As a group including refugees, asylum seekers, and other members, IWG members felt the pain of the situation. The aim of our campaign was to empower women to respond.

We wrote to local MSP Paul Sweeney and the Scottish government, both of whom support a two-state solution, and received detailed responses on continuing aid to the area from Scotland. We also hosted Jean Byrne from the Friends of Palestine group in Glasgow, who recently returned from the area and spoke about the illegal settlements by the Israeli government. Additionally, we discussed the issue with the local mosque.

The grant covered hall hire, refreshments, travel expenses, stationery costs, and helped host the campaign. We feel more empowered in the legal and political process, as well as in responding to conflict against our community. We are very grateful for the support from SEAD.
