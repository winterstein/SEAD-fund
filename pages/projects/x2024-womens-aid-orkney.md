> "Our project is to set up women's gardening group. This will be based in our refuge garden and in a NHS polytunnel where we have been offered a space to use for free.
> 
> We require a range of gardening tools, gloves, seeds, feed and compost.
> 
> We aim to bring together women affected by domestic abuse and offer an activity which is calming, educational, builds a sense of community, reduces social isolation, builds confidence and promotes a fork to plate approach to growing fruit and vegetables."
