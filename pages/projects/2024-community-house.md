We transformed our front garden from a plain space to something much more inviting. The children loved being involved in choosing the planters, flowers, and decorative items to brighten up the area.

The first part of the project involved weeding the space, clearing away rubbish, and preparing small planters with flowers. The children enjoyed getting their hands dirty and chose where to place the planters, adding decorative items to make the garden their own.

Upcycling old pallets added more color to our space and allowed for more flowers to be planted. The completion of the front garden project has brought smiles, laughs, and joy to the children using our services. They made decisions, designed, got involved, and worked in teams to transform the space. The children love this space now, and with the seating area, it is used much more. They will continue to be involved in maintaining the space and are immensely proud of their work, as are we!

Thank you from everyone at Community House for your generosity.
