organisation: The Haven Learning

This project supported children with dyslexia. The original plan was to purchase a special smart reading pen. This was changed when the local school offered a pen of this type, sadly with poor results. Technology doesn't always deliver for everyone. 

So The Haven adjusted plans, and used the money to provide a set of reduced price lessons.
