organisation: Mbarara RISE Foundation

In March 2023, Ugandan MPs passed the KILL THE GAY bill, imposing the death penalty for homosexuality. As state and local governments move to enforce homophobic laws, we have heard from people who have faced arrests, evictions, attacks, and sexual violence. Access to health services has been cut off, and many have been left unemployed due to hate campaigns and mob attacks.

With the grant Received from SEAD-Fund, we are grateful that we managed to make out project a success. We Managed to run Protesting on the streets Of Mbarara City, Chanting pride songs alongside our grievances. We are humans just like any other human expressing their desired sexual identity. 

Our protest advocated for equality, safe homes and families, and health care, and against human rights violations and attacks on the LGBTQ Community.

The Mbarara RISE Foundation provides assistance and information about safety, security, and equal human rights for the LGBTIQ+ community in Uganda. We continue the fight against laws that criminalize homosexuality.
