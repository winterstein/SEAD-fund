J8 empowers young people to help each other on a global scale. This school-linking scheme started as a pupil-driven project at Hutcheson's Grammar School in Glasgow, when students entered a UNICEF competition to solve the world's biggest problems. The group realised that lack of education is behind many social issues both in the UK and further afield, and began reaching out to schools in Africa and Asia. J8 ask pupils in their partner schools to use their local knowledge to research how education is delivered in their area, and how it can be improved. Together, they work out an action plan, and work on fundraising, including developing products for sale.

J8 now partner with seven communities around the world, working with their international peers to find specialised solutions for local issues.
