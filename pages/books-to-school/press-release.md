Arusha, Tanzania â€“ SEAD-Fund, in collaboration with Fahari Safari, is proud to announce the launch of the "Books to School" program. This initiative invites safari guests to bring along second-hand children's books to donate, helping to create and grow school libraries in Tanzania, where many children have no access to such resources.

These books are invaluable, helping to teach English with a dose of joy, and fostering a lifelong love for reading. 

> Participating in the *Books to School* program is simple: Just pack a few English-language children's books in your luggage. Our team will deliver the books to local schools in need.

By participating, tourists will contribute to the local community, leaving a positive and lasting impact from your safari experience. This initiative is a unique opportunity to make a difference, one book at a time.

Think of your favourite childhood book. Now imagine the joy of sharing that book with a child who has never had the chance to read it -- a child who might never have read any children's books, only textbooks. This is the magic of the *Books to School* program.

The "Books to School" program was established through the joint efforts of Fahari Safari and the SEAD-Fund charity. Together, we aim to bring joy and educational resources to children in Tanzania, enriching their learning environments and their lives.

Participation is optional, and is open to all tourists. The program has started with safaris in Tanzania, but will also cover Zanzibar, Kenya, and Uganda.

**Travel with purpose, and help make a difference - one book at a time.**
